    <h1>Welcome to Nicholas Cage Fan Club Site Webpage</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Clint, and I developed an obsession with Nicholas Cage after my best friend started dropping all the cool facts about him. I also have a passion for understanding how the Cage works. Outside of watching Nicholas Cage movies, I enjoy spending time with my family, gardening, and working on various projects that keep me busy and engaged.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I also enjoy following and participating in sports. Whether it's watching a game or playing with friends, sports offer a great way to stay active and have fun. I'm also preparing for my next career move into a remote IT job, a field that has always intrigued me due to its dynamic and ever-evolving nature.</p>
